**Factor Aligned Reversal Model with Volatility and Risk Management Filters**

Objective: Capture short-term price reversals within broader trends, using technical confirmation and robust risk controls.

Technical Triggers: Candlestick patterns (Hammer for bullish, Shooting Star for bearish) are identified at key market levels.

Trend Filter: Only invests in the direction of the 200-day moving average are considered.

Volatility Filter: Uses True Range Delta and ATR for filtering noise and sizing investments.

Risk Management: Stop-loss and profit targets are defined using ATR multiples, with dynamic tightening during high volatility.

Output: Long and short signals are based on high-probability pattern setups, validated by momentum and volatility conditions, and executed with strict risk controls.
