**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model**

Objective: Estimate the intrinsic value of a stock using projected free cash flows, risk-adjusted discounting, and quality metrics.

Cash Flow Projection: Forecasts Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) over multiple years.

Discounting: Uses Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as the discount rate, derived from market data and assumptions.

Quality Assessment: Includes Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to evaluate whether the firm generates value over its cost of capital.

Output: Intrinsic value per share compared to market price, helping determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.
