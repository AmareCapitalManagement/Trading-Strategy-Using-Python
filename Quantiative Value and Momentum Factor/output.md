**Quantitative Value and Momentum Factor Strategy**

Objective: Identify stocks that are fundamentally undervalued and technically strong.

Value Metrics: Screens for undervaluation using ratios such as P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and EV/GP.

Momentum Metrics: Measures price strength across 1M, 3M, 6M, and 1Y timeframes.

Logic: Stocks with low valuation metrics may revert to intrinsic value, while momentum stocks continue their trends due to investor behavior. This strategy combines both dimensions for a composite ranking.

Output: A ranked list of stocks that are simultaneously cheap and trending up â€” ideal for long positions; the opposite list may signal shorts or avoids.
