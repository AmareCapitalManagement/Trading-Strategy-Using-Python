**Anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (AVWAPs)**

Objective: Identify dynamic support/resistance levels and trend context using volume-weighted price anchoring.

Core Tool: Anchored VWAPs from significant price events (e.g., yearly open, local highs/lows).

Signal Logic: Trades are initiated near AVWAP levels, supported by ATR filters and SMA confirmation.

Flexibility: Adaptable to daily or intraday trading (5min/15min) for swing or day trades.

Output: Annotated charts and strategy tables showing entry signals, risk levels, and trend bias. Helps traders time entries in trending markets with strong volume-price alignment.
