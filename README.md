**Company Description**

Name: Amare Capital Management (Pty) Ltd

Structure: Entrepreneurial Investment Partnership (EIP)

Location: Pretoria, South Africa

Leadership: Kabelo Junior Mosaka, Co-Founder and Hedge Fund Manager (Bachelor of Commerce in Finance)

Contact: +27 65 852 2723 / kabelojunior10@gmail.com

Mission: To achieve sustainable, risk-adjusted returns through systematic, evidence-based investment strategies leveraging undervaluation and price momentum.

Vision: To establish Amare Capital Management as a leading long-short equity hedge fund in South Africa, recognized for disciplined capital allocation and innovative trading strategies.

Goal: Aiming to scale Assets Under Management (AUM) to R1 billion through disciplined investing and strategic capital growth.

**Business Objectives**

In the short term (1–2 years), the goal is to build a robust investment portfolio using the initial capital of the fund. This portfolio will aim to generate positive returns through a blend of long-term investments and short-term trading in Contracts for Difference (CFDs). Over the medium term (3–5 years), the strategy focuses on scaling the portfolio by reinvesting profits and attracting additional capital, leveraging a proven track record of performance. In the long term (5+ years), the objective is to establish the fund as a high-performing hedge fund by consistently compounding capital and building a credible investment history.

**Investment Strategy**

The fund’s strategy combines value and momentum-based statistical factors with technical trading strategies and fundamental valuation models.

The value factor component targets undervalued stocks based on fundamental valuation metrics. Stocks that appear cheap relative to their intrinsic worth are selected for long positions, with the expectation of outperformance. Conversely, stocks that appear overvalued are considered for short positions, assuming a potential mean reversion. The momentum factor seeks stocks demonstrating strong recent price performance across multiple timeframes, aiming to capture short-term trends through CFD trades.

A fundamental investing approach is used through a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. This model estimates the intrinsic value of stocks based on projected future free cash flows, which are discounted back to present value using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). This approach allows us to assess whether a stock is trading below its intrinsic value, validating if the investment aligns with our long-term compounding criteria and fundamental margin of safety.

Using a long-short equity approach, the fund goes long on undervalued stocks with strong momentum to benefit from long-term appreciation. At the same time, it shorts overvalued or weak-momentum stocks to hedge risk and enhance returns, creating a market-neutral position where appropriate.

The strategy also incorporates trend-following technical systems, which form the bedrock of our backtesting framework. The Trend-Aligned Reversal Strategy uses candlestick reversal patterns such as hammer and shooting star formations, filtered by moving averages and volatility measures like the True Range Delta. Risk is managed through predefined stop-losses and profit targets. The Anchored VWAP Strategy identifies trend directions and optimal trade entries and exits using Anchored Volume Weighted Average Prices, further supported by ATR and SMA indicators for both daily and intraday setups. The EWMAC (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Crossovers) Strategy is designed to capture medium- to long-term price trends with signals adjusted for volatility. These technical strategies not only guide trade execution but also serve as the foundation for our rigorous backtesting system, allowing us to test historical performance, validate signal reliability, and continuously refine our approach based on quantitative evidence.

**Market Analysis**

Amare Capital Management (Pty) Ltd positions itself to capitalize on the growing acceptance of hedge funds in South Africa. With only 39 retail hedge funds available across 11 management companies, the sector remains niche, offering significant room for new entrants. Our value proposition is tailored to exploit inefficiencies in the JSE, a market prone to volatility and mispriced assets

**Conclusion**

Amare Capital Management (Pty) Ltd combines rigorous quantitative analysis with disciplined risk management to deliver consistent, risk-adjusted returns. We aim to capitalize on undervalued, high-momentum stocks and short-term trading opportunities in the JSE. Our innovative quantiatative statistical strategy, supported by advanced technical tools and fundamental analysis, positions us for sustainable growth and long-term success in South Africa’s dynamic financial markets.
