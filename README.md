# PYTHON BACKTESTING: HAMMER REVERSAL WITH VOLATILITY FILTER 

This strategy identifies potential bullish reversals using the hammer candlestick pattern, filtered by the asset's position relative to its 200-day moving average and volatility conditions measured by the True Range Delta. It aims to enter long positions when a hammer candle forms under specific conditions and manage risk with stop-losses, profit-targets, and specific situation handling. The approach is backtested across multiple tickers to ensure robustness, reflecting Amare Capital Management's commitment to rigorous statistical validation.
