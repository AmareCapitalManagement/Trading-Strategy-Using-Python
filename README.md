**Investment Strategy**

Value and Momentum Statistical Factors:

Value Factor: Identifies undervalued stocks using valuation metrics. Stocks with the lowest valuation metrics are targeted for long positions, assuming they are undervalued and likely to outperform. Stocks with the highest valuation metrics are targeted for short-positions, assuming they are overvalued and likey to revert to the mean.

Momentum Factor: Targets stocks with strong recent price performance across different timeframes, capitalizing on short-term price trends for CFD trading.

Long-Short Equity Approach: Buys undervalued stocks with high momentum for long-term appreciation and shorts overvalued or low-momentum stocks to hedge risk and enhance returns.

Trend-Following Technical Strategies:

Trend-Aligned Reversal Strategy: Uses hammer and shooting star candlestick patterns, filtered by the Moving Average and volatility (True Range Delta), with risk management via stop-losses and profit targets to identify potential bullish and bearish reversals.

Anchored VWAP Strategy: Identifies trends and entry/exit points using Anchored Volume Weighted Average Prices (VWAPs), supplemented by ATR and SMA for daily and intraday trading.

EWMAC Trend-Following Strategy: Employs Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Crossovers to capture medium- to long-term trends, with volatility-adjusted signals.

Fundamental Analysis Investing Stratgy:

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model: Estimates intrinsic stock values using Discounted Cash Flow analysis to validate investment decisions.
